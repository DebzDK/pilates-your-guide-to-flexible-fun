                <h2>What is Pilates?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Pilates is a system of exercise, developed by a man named Joseph Pilates, that aims to
                    evenly strengthen the body to improve one's general wellbeing and fitness.
                    <br>
                    Joseph believed that physical and mental health were closely linked and set about developing pilates
                    in hopes of creating a system of exercise that allievates ill health.
                    <br>
                    Unlike yoga, which originates from ancient India, pilates is modelled after disciplines from the Western world
                    such as gymnastics, boxing, and Greco-Roman wrestling. They both, however, emphasis the existence of a
                    connection between physical and mental health.

                <h2>Why should you do it?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Although not scientifically-proven, pilates is said to improve posture, muscle tone,
                    flexibility, balance, and joint mobility, as well as relieve tension and stress.
                    Speaking from personal experience, I'd compare pilates to taking your car in for a tune-up.
                    It relaxes and loosens up your body in a way that feels great and improves your mood.

                <h2>How do you do it?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Multiple forms of pilates are taught today due to people adopting and adapting the core
                    principles, interpreting them in their own way, and sometimes adding in new ones.
                    The best way to do pilates is to find a class or YouTube video(s) that teach pilates'
                    exercises that appeal to you.
