                <h2>What is Pilates?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Pilates is a system of exercise, developed by a man named Joseph Pilates, that aims to
                    evenly strengthen the body to improve one's general wellbeing and fitness.
                    <br>
                    Joseph believed that physical and mental health were closely linked and set about developing pilates
                    in hopes of creating a system of exercise that allievates ill health.
                    <br>
                    Unlike yoga, which originates from ancient India, pilates is modelled after disciplines from the Western world
                    such as gymnastics, boxing, and Greco-Roman wrestling. They both, however, emphasis the existence of a
                    connection between physical and mental health.

                <h2>Why should you do it?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Although not scientifically-proven, pilates is said to improve posture, muscle tone,
                    flexibility, balance, and joint mobility, as well as relieve tension and stress.
                    Speaking from personal experience, I'd compare pilates to taking your car in for a tune-up.
                    It relaxes and loosens up your body in a way that feels great and improves your mood.

                <h2>How do you do it?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Multiple forms of pilates are taught today due to people adopting and adapting the core
                    principles, interpreting them in their own way, and sometimes adding in new ones.
                    The best way to do pilates is to find a class or YouTube video(s) that teach pilates'
                    exercises that appeal to you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the next section, basic yet effective pilates will be covered
                    to give you an idea of what to expect.

                        When something's wrong with a car, it gets taken to a mechanic right? Even when there's nothing wrong with it, it may require
                        a tune-up or it may be time for an MOT check-up.
                        <br>
                        When something's wrong with our bodies, we go to a doctor but what's our
                        equivalent of a tune-up?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A combination of regular exercise and keeping a healthy, balanced diet is the answer.
                        <br>
                        To be functioning at our best, we don't need to be in the gym 24/7. Setting aside time, from as little as a few
                        minutes a day or once a week, is important in maintaining general fitness and therefore a 'tuned-up' body.
                        Pilates can be your tune-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those who live a more sedentary lifestyle, pilates can help you become more active by easing you into a routine
                        of low-intensity, core-strengthening exercises that promote balanced muscular strength as well as flexibility.
                        <br>
                        For those living a more active lifestyle, especially those who go hard at the gym, pilates can help you to avoid
                        injuries resulting from the inflexibilty that comes from not warming up before an exercise or spending too much time
                        working on muscular gain without taking the time to stretch.
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        In our day-to-day lives, be it due to work or other responsibilities, we often forget to take time out for ourselves.
                        This might seem insignificant to most people but, overtime, disregarding ourselves leads to a build-up of stress
                        that if left unchecked will leak into other areas of our lives until it can no longer be ignored.
                        <br>
                        Manifestations of this can be as small as headaches and short-temperedness or as big as mental health issues.
                        Speaking from personal experience, stress can also manifest in the body in the form of skin and digestion issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So why let it get that far in the first place? It doesn't need to be a long period of time.
                        <br>
                        A few minutes is all it takes to wind down after a long day.
