## Features

Each feature listed below was chosen to provide users with a clear, logical path through the site content in order for this project to achieve its goal.

### Existing features
* Navigation bar
  * Positioned at the top of the page, the full-length responsive navigation bar includes the site name, logo, and links to the home page, 'Mindfulness' sub-sections - 'Body' and 'Mental Health' and 'Purpose' section.
  * The 'Mindfulness' sub-sections become accessible from a dropdown menu when 'Mindfulness' is hovered in order to economise on space.
  * The navigation bar layout adjusts to make use of available space on smaller screens, eventually becoming a burger menu when there is no longer enough space to display the words in the bar. This provides value for the user through ease of navigation by placing it in the position users typically expect to see a navivgatio bar.

* Mindfulness - Body section
    * The 'Body' section will argue the importance of taking care of and paying attention to the body in order for it not to reach breaking point due to inactivity or not living a healthy lifestyle.
